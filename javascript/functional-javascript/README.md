## Concepts

**First-class**

- Something is just a value
- Can go anywhere that any other value can go

**High-order function**

- Function as an argument
- Return a function as a result

**Imperative programming**

> Further, imperative languages are often restricted to a level of detail that is good for their compilers rather than for their programmers (Sokolowski 1991).

**Metaprogramming**

> "Programming occurs when you write code that changes the way that something is interpreted. Metaprogramming occurs when you write code that changes the way that something is interpreted"
